# How To Play
### TukTikTak
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns marking the spaces in the grid, one with 'X' and the other with 'O'.
- The objective is to get three of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- The first player to do this wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

### Juesser
- Choose your mode: Easy (1 to 100), Medium (1 to 500), or Hard (1 to 1000).
- The computer will randomly pick a number within the range of the chosen mode.
- You have to guess the number. After each guess, the game will tell you if the correct number is higher or lower than your guess.
- Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
- Points are awarded based on the difficulty level: 1 point for Easy, 5 points for Medium, and 10 points for Hard.

### PeePooFart
- You and the computer will each choose one of the three options: Pee, Poo, or Fart.
- The rules are simple:
  - Pee beats Poo.
  - Poo beats Fart.
  - Fart beats Pee.
- If you and the computer pick the same option, it's a draw.
- The objective is to beat the computer by choosing the winning option. Good luck!
